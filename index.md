**Census Data** 

The last census results have been completed and all data has been compiled. It is now available for review covering many different demographics. I was rather surprised to see the results regarding voting data. I fully expected to see a drastic difference between the number of voters between men and women. However, this is not what I discovered.

Of the 231,416,670 million people who answered voting questions in the census, the number of men and women was nearly equal. However, the number of women who voted outnumbered men by nearly 7,000,000 people. I was rather surprised to see the numbers to close, although I have a hard time considering 7,000,000 voters close.

In recent years, there has been a push for women to get out to vote. For all of the strides made towards equality and women's rights, it all comes down to actually exercising those rites and voting. I believe that this is the reason why women are voting in greater numbers than men. This is rather impressive given the pandemic caused great fear for people to even head out to the polls.

I would be interested to see how this compares to other elections and with previous census results. I would imagine the number of men outnumbered the number of women during he last census. I would also imagine that the last election played into this, as a woman was on the ballot running for president. Perhaps this and the last administration have provided the impetus for women to vote in droves.

Additionally, during this time, the life of Ruth Badder Ginsburg was celebrated in her final years and upon her death. Her life and legacy has lifted women and served as a reminder of the work that still must be done in order to maintain and grow the rights we have fought so hard to attain. Hopefully, time does not diminish her legacy and that it will continue to be that solid and strong foundation for women's rights and to help propell the next generation of women leaders to follow in her footsteps.

I am rather surprised that the number of men voting is in decline. It would be interesting to see if this is an actual decline or just an unprecedented and growing increase in the number of women voting. Perhaps the number of men has remained stagnant, but this is worth investigating based on the information provided in the data presented her. Looking at historical data would certainly help to provide an overall picture of what is happening, although it may not fully explain why. I hope to be able to explore this further to shed some light on this very interesting trend. It will also be interesting to see if this is a trend that continues strongly, or if there will be a constant ebb and flow between who overtakes who at the polls.
